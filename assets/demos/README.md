This folder contains the generated samples from our models under two settings:

1. **4Q Conditions**: Visit the "4Q" folder for samples generated under four-quadrant emotion conditions. This folder is divided into three subfolders named after the model type. Each subfolder houses 12 musical pieces, three for each emotion quadrant. For instance, the file "Q1_0.wav" in the "functional(two)" subfolder represents the first example of a Q1 emotion generated by our functional(two) method.

2. **Arousal Control**: Check the "Arousal" folder for demonstrations of our new application, i.e., controlling the arousal levels of performances under the same lead sheet. This folder includes subfolders for "REMI(two)" and "functional(two)" models. Each contains 6 pairs of samples: three pairs showing high/low arousal performances for a high valence (positive) lead sheet and three pairs for a low valence (negative) lead sheet. For example, the files "positive_HA_1.wav" and "positive_LA_1.wav" correspond to high and low arousal performances, respectively, for a high valence (positive) lead sheet.

You can also visit our [demo page](https://emo-disentanger.github.io/) to listen to the samples. Thank you for your attention!
