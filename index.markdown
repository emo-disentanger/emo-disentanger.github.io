## Introduction

In this paper, we propose a novel **functional representation** designed as an alternative to [REMI](https://github.com/YatingMusic/remi), 
a popular event representation that uses note pitch values and chord names to encode symbolic music.

representation, differing in note pitch and chord name events.</figcaption>

This new method takes **musical keys** into account, 
recognizing their significant role in shaping musicâ€™s emotional character through major-minor tonality.

Specifically, our method represents both melody notes and chords with Roman numerals relative to musical keys, 
a **functional format** considering the relationships between notes, chords and scales (major or minor).

It also allows for melodic variation with respect to keys and addresses the problem of data scarcity for better emotion modeling. 

A Transformer is employed to harmonize key-adaptable melodies, allowing for keys determined in rule-based or model-based manner.
